<p>Terms of Service</p>
<p>Part 1</p></font></center>

<ul>
<li> 
    By agreeing to this ToS you confirm that you are over eighteen years of age. You must be over 18 to commission me. 
</li>
<li>
    Unfortunately, due to VAT codes, I cannot accept commissions from clients in the European Union.
</li>
<li>
    Payment is to be sent upfront, prior to beginning of work. On confirmed reception of payment, work will be completed within three weeks (21 days) unless otherwise negotiated.
</li>
<!--previous policy, retained here for memory's sake. not currently implemented. 
    
    Payment must be sent on (within 100 kiloseconds of) completion of the completed work (pre-payment image is watermarked and of lower resolution), unless otherwise agreed.-->
<li>
    You may request (although I am not guaranteed to <i>accept</i>) a different idea to what you initially asked for if I have not yet begun work. Significant changes in requested topic during the sketch phase incurs a 30% "retooling" charge.
</li>
</ul>

    <li>
        I assert the moral right of attribution over the produced image(s) (plain english: no passing off my work as your own. Credit me.)
    </li>
    <li>
        You may modify the produced image(s) yourself, or have someone else colour linework for you. It must be acknowledged that edtis were made by outside parties when the work is posted.
    </li>
    <li>
        Unless otherwise negotiated, I reserve the right to post the commissioned image(s) to any social media platform (that is to say, you will have to pay extra if you don't want me to post what I draw you).
    </li>
    <li>
        Unless otherwise negotiated, I reserve the right to use the produced image(s) for promotional purposes (your commission may be used as an example on a price sheet, for example).
