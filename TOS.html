<ul>
<li> 
    By agreeing to this ToS you confirm that you are over eighteen years of age. You must be over 18 to commission me. 
</li>
<li>
    Unfortunately, due to VAT codes, I cannot accept commissions from clients in the European Union. By agreeing to this ToS you confirm that you are not paying for this commission from within the European Union.
</li>
<li>
    Payment must be sent on (within 24 hours of) completion of the completed work (pre-payment image is watermarked and of lower resolution), unless otherwise agreed.
</li>
<!--potential future policies, retained here for memory's sake. not currently implemented. 
    
    Payment is to be sent upfront, prior to beginning of work. On confirmed reception of payment, work will be completed within three weeks (21 days) unless otherwise negotiated.

    Payment must be sent on (within 100 kiloseconds of) completion of the completed work (pre-payment image is watermarked and of lower resolution), unless otherwise agreed.-->
<li>
    You may request (although I am not guaranteed to <i>accept</i>) a different idea to what you initially asked for if I have not yet begun work. Significant changes in requested topic during the sketch phase incurs a 30% "retooling" charge.
</li>
<li>
    I reserve the right to cease work on the commission at any time, for any reason including but not limited to ill health. If prepayment has been negotiated and sent, it will be refunded in this event.
</li>
<li>
    You may cancel your commission prior to me beginning work on it, although doing this multiple times is grounds for being disqualified from future commissions.
</li>
<li>
    I reserve the right to decline to take a commission for any reason.
</li>
</ul>

        Unless otherwise negotiated I reserve copyright over the produced image(s) (but not the characters in the image - unless they are my own characters); no commercial use is permitted.

        I assert the moral right of attribution over the produced image(s) (plain english: no passing off my work as your own. Credit me.)
    </li>

        You may modify the produced image(s) yourself, or have someone else colour linework for you. It must be acknowledged that edits were made by outside parties when the work is posted.
    </li>
    <li>
        Unless otherwise negotiated, I reserve the right to post the commissioned image(s) to any social media platform (that is to say, you will have to pay extra if you don't want me to post what I draw you).
    </li>
    <li>
        Unless otherwise negotiated, I reserve the right to use the produced image(s) for promotional purposes (your commission may be used as an example on a price sheet, for example).
